### Identifiers
This chapter discusses the general use of identifiers and nationally specific identifiers. CZ Identifiers are used extensively to consistently identify real world entities across systems, contexts of use, and other formats in CZ profiles.

#### General identifiers

At the general level it is used identifiers in the URI format.
The unique identifier URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) ​​is standardized by the RFC 3986 standard. It is a reference to a certain resource, such as a web page. A URI typically includes a scheme (eg https), an authority (eg domain), a path, and an object identifier. If a URI refers to the identification of a unique document, that URI may be considered a unique identifier.

The URI format allows the creation of identifiers of several types. In our national environment, these two types are mainly used:

##### UUID
UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) ​​is represented by URI RFC 9562 (obsoleted RFC 4122). An identifier is generated to be virtually unique worldwide and is often used to identify objects and entities in various systems, databases and applications. A UUID is a 128-bit number that is usually represented as 32 hexadecimal numbers separated by dashes like: urn:uuid:c757873d-ec9a-4326-a141-556f43239520.

HL7 FHIR use UUID as a primitive data type as part of complex data types and represents it in the form of URI (universal resource identifier) according to RFC 4122. UUID shell be represented in lower case.

Format must match following regular expression:
~~~
urn:uuid:[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}
~~~

##### OID
The OID (Object Identifier), which is used for unique identification in IT, is standardized by ISO/IEC standards. It is a unique identifier used in information technology for unambiguously distinguishing objects, attributes and data structures within organizations, systems and standards. An OID is a hierarchical identifier in the form of numbers separated by dots that represent the path to a given object in a hierarchy defined by a given organizational or standardization system, such as ISO. 

OID enables unambiguous identification and addressing of data elements and entities within different systems and facilitates interoperability and resource management.

Format must match following regular expression:
~~~
urn:oid:[0-2](\.(0|[1-9][0-9]*))*
~~~

#### Nationally specific identifier

Defined in this implementation guide are profiles for identifiers for use in populating the following data elements:
* Patient.Identifier
* Device.Identifier
* Document.Identifier
* Organization.Identifier
* Practitioner.Identifier

All identifiers must be unique within the identifier type.

##### Patient Identifier
If it is known, it is mandatory to enter at least one national or international identifier (birth number, passport number, etc.). Usually, if available, one of the national identifiers is used (patient number from the national patient register, birth number, insurance number).

###### Personal (National) Healthcare Identifier (RID, DRID)
*RID* (Resortní Identifikátor) is a unique personal identifier of each patient in who has been in contact with health services in the Czech Republic and has been duly identified. The identifier is assigned when the patient is recorded in the national Master patient register (KRP). RID is a meaningless ten-digit number that cannot begin with zero, is divisible by 13, and is not divisible by 11.

Patients that cannot be duly identified due to different reasons are assigned a temporary healthcare identifier (DRID). DRID is generated by the Master patient register (KRP) on request of healthcare providers. DRID shares the same namespace with RID but its syntax is different: starts with letter "D" and contains 9 digit unique number which is not subject to any further restrictions.

The identifier namespace is: https://ncez.mzcr.cz/fhir/sid/rid.

Format must match following regular expression:
~~~
(D\d{9}|[1-9]\d{9})
~~~

###### Birth Number
Birth Numbers are assigned:
* natural person upon birth or adoption of a minor natural person
* a citizen who has not yet had a birth number, foreigners with a residence permit in the territory of the Czech Republic
* a foreigner who has been granted international protection in the form of asylum or supplementary protection on the territory of the Czech Republic
* a foreigner who applied for the allocation of a birth number in order to fulfill the conditions according to a special legal regulation, e.g. university studies, employment, etc.
* a natural person for whom the Czech Social Security Administration or the District Social Security Administration has requested the allocation of a birth number in accordance with a special legal regulation.

It is required that the namespace be filled with the value: https://ncez.mzcr.cz/fhir/sid/rcis

A unique identifier value assigned by some of the Dispensing Points. Rule for birth numbers: Minimum length: 9 characters, maximum length: 10 characters and must be a number that matches this expression:
~~~
[0-9]{2}(?:[0257][1-9]|[1368][ 0-2])(?:0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])[0-9]{3,4}
~~~

###### Passport Number
Passport Number is a unique ID number that confirms that a person is a citizen of a given country.

Name space according to the passport issuer. Standard Passport Namespaces are required to be used. FHIR registers namespaces for passports in the format http://hl7.org/fhir/sid/passport-XXX, where XXX is the ISO 3166 three-letter country code.

###### Identity Card Number
Identity Card Number is is assigned when the identity card is created. The identifier namespace in this case is presented by the value from this: https://ncez.mzcr.cz/fhir/sid/op.

###### Health Insurance Number
It is a number which is created by heath insurance provider. The identifier namespace in this case is presented by the value from this: https://ncez.mzcr.cz/fhir/sid/cpoj

##### Device Identifier
This is a unique device identifier that is standardized according to EU Regulation 2017/745. The ‘Unique Device Identifier’ (knows as‘UDI’) is a series of numeric or alphanumeric characters that is created through a globally accepted device identification and coding standard. It allows the unambiguous identification of a specific device on the market. The UDI is comprised of the UDI-DI and the UDI-PI.

The UDI-DI is a unique numeric or alphanumeric code specific to a model of device and that is also used as the ‘access key’ to information stored in a UDI database.

The UDI-PI is a numeric or alphanumeric code that identifies the unit of device production.
The different types of UDI-PIs include serial number, lot number, software identification and manufacturing or expiry date or both types of date.

The word ‘Unique’ does not imply serialisation of individual production units.

##### Document Identifier
The document identifier enables the unique identification of medical documentation. It is recommended to use identifiers of the UUID type (preferred). The document identifier is generally defined as a simple string of characters. The primary condition is that it must be unique in a given namespace. To ensure interoperability, it is also necessary that the document can be searched for using this identifier, in combination with the namespace.

##### Organization Identifier
Within the organization, it is necessary to use at least one national unique Identifier, which is used to identify the organization. Typically, the NRPZS value and/or the IČO value are stated. It is allowed to include information from other identification systems. The use of the identifier NRPZS is preferred.

###### KRPZS
This identification is according to the National Register of Health Service Providers. The identifier namespace in this case is presented by the value: https://ncez.mzcr.cz/fhir/sid/krpzs.
The format must match this regular expression:
~~~
\d{8}
~~~
###### IČO
Identification number of a person using the eight-digit identification number of a legal entity, a natural person doing business or an organizational component of the state. The identifier namespace in this case is presented by the value: https://ncez.mzcr.cz/fhir/sid/ico.
The format must match this regular expression:
~~~
\d{8}
~~~

###### KP (Health Insurance Company Code)
Identification number of a health insurance companies using the three-digit identification number of a company. The identifier namespace in this case is presented by the value: https://www.dastacr.cz/dasta/nclp_data/ds_UZIS/ZdravotniPojistovna.xml.
The format must match this regular expression:
~~~
\d{3}
~~~

###### Others
There are two other possible types of identifier according to IČZ (Namespace: https://ncez.mzcr.cz/fhir/sid/icz) and IČP (Namespace: https://ncez.mzcr.cz/fhir/sid/icp). However, these identifiers are not required.
IČZ is the identification number of the healthcare provider. IČP is the identification number of the workplace (or doctor) within one IČZ.
IČZ and IČP are assigned exclusively by VZP ČR for the needs of all health insurance companies in the Czech Republic. Therefore, an application for assignment of IČZ and IČP is always submitted to VZP ČR, regardless of which health insurance company will pay for the provided emergency care.
There may be several different IČPs within an IČZ. IČZ usually ends with 000, IČP has the first 5 characters identical to IČZ and the last three digits different, but this may not always be the case.

##### Practitioner Identifier
It is used to identify medical and non-medical workers according to "č. 372/2011 Sb.". It is necessary to use at least one national unique identifier within the organization. The preferred identifier is the KRZP type identifier.

###### KRZP
Unique identifier is registered within the Master Register of Healthcare Professionals (KRZP). The healthcare professional identifier is assigned by the Ministry when a healthcare professional is registered in the Master Register of Healthcare Professionals (KRZP). Each healthcare professional is identified by only one identifier. The healthcare professional identifier cannot be changed after assignment, unless otherwise provided by law (e.g.: in the event of duplicate identifiers, when previous ones are cancelled and new unique identifiers are generated for individual entities). Its format is a meaningless nine-digit number that must not start with a zero. In this case, the identifier namespace is presented by the value: https://ncez.mzcr.cz/fhir/sid/krzp
The format must correspond to this regular expression:
~~~
[1-9]\d{8}
~~~

###### ČLK
Identification number of a healthcare professional according to ČLK. The identifier namespace is presented in this case by the value: https://ncez.mzcr.cz/fhir/sid/clk

###### ČLek
Identification number of a healthcare professional (pharmacist) according to ČLek. The identifier namespace is presented in this case by the value: https://ncez.mzcr.cz/fhir/sid/clek
